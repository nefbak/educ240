    <h1>Out of Our Control</h1>
    <div class="im1"> <img src="img4/img.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img2.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img3.png" alt=""><img src="img4/img17.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img18.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img19.png" alt="">
    <p> When an object hits the water, whether it's as light as a feather or as heavy as a stone, it creates circular ripples. These ripples reflect the forces of gravity and the vibrations of the Earth, forming beautiful and undeniable patterns. We witness this as we dive into a pool or skip stones across a lake. Some forces, like gravity, are unassailable, just as educational institutions shape our identities and potential. They mold us into something new, but ultimately, our true selves remain constant, like the stone hitting the water, eventually resurfacing to reveal who we are.</p>
    <p> In life, we can sometimes feel like we're in a spiraling tornado, especially in a classroom setting. We might feel diminished and inferior, believing that our lack of understanding prevents future success. This stress can manifest as anxiety, which for me resembles a tornado, where I feel lost, lacking control, and uncertain about how to proceed. It's as if my future is predetermined by academic success. Schools often reinforce the idea that success follows a singular path: education, employment, financial stability, wealth, and eventually death. Straying from this path can make it seem like our world is spiraling out of control, obscuring the way to happiness and success. Although this belief is false, the educational system perpetuates it, which I find deeply frustrating.</p>
    <p>As a student, I know how school can make you feel like you're drowning in a sea of people who seem to have everything figured out. With backpacks, headphones, and phones, we isolate ourselves from each other. I walk among my peers feeling like an impostor, assuming they have clarity and confidence. Being in school often feels like being a solitary whirlpool in a calm sea. Yet, I maintain a facade, pretending I'm okay, that I belong, and that I'm thriving academically. Others see me the same way I see them, leaving us all feeling alienated, like isolated whirlpools within the ocean.</p>

    <h1>The Authoriy of Time</h1>
    <div class="im1"> <img src="img4/img11.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img12.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img13.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img20.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img21.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img22.png" alt="">
        <p>As students, we all follow a schedule, bound by the authority of time. Time moves in a circular pattern. As the Earth revolves around the Sun, shadows shift, the second hand ticks around the clock, and we move with time. In the morning, we wake up and get ready for school. At noon, we eat lunch, and by 3 PM, we board the bus home. At 4 PM, we catch up on homework, at 7 PM, we eat dinner, and by 10 PM, we head to bed, only to repeat the cycle. We wake up the next day at 8 AM, and the Earth, the clock, and the shadows have reset. We begin our circle again. Although we have the freedom to choose how we spend our time, we cannot control its passage. Time moves forward, we grow older each day, and we cannot stop it. We must always work within its schedule, making the most of the time we have.</p>
        <p> Each year, teachers receive a new group of students and impart the same lessons they have taught to previous classes. This process represents the reproduction of cycles that persist without interruption. They are given a fresh cohort of children to shape, yet the content remains the same, perpetuating an unbroken pattern. How can we expand and grow as individuals if the material, teaching methods, and learning environments all remain unchanged? Despite our incredible ability to adapt in many aspects of life, the education system often remains stagnant. This is disappointing and unfair to children, whose individuality and spirit are being eroded. As time goes by, it's as if we are trapped in an infinite circle. The cycles continue unchanged, and we are all waiting for the day they are broken so that future generations can truly be free.</p>

    <h1>Everything Is Connected</h1>
    <div class="im1"> <img src="img4/img5.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img6.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img7.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img10.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img8.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img9.png" alt="">
        <p>Everything in our world seems to move in circles and cycles. Our perception of the world, through the circular lenses of our eyes, reflects this pattern. Our lives follow a cyclical rhythm; days repeat in an unbroken sequence, and we often remain confined within our habitual bubbles. Even the cells that compose our bodies are circular. We reside on Earth, shaped by gravity into a sphere, which orbits the circular Sun. The Moon, also spherical, revolves around Earth, while the other planets follow similar orbital paths. When we compare an atom to a solar system, the resemblance is striking, illustrating that from the smallest scales of life to the vast galaxies, everything follows circular dynamics. Circles and cycles pervade our existence, and humans seem to find solace in these patterns, which are an inherent aspect of our reality.</p>
            
            <p>  The education system operates within a cyclical framework, and breaking free from this cycle has proven challenging. If these cycles bring us comfort and reflect the fundamental nature of our surroundings, why should we alter them? We've all navigated the same educational system and emerged relatively well, haven't we? Yet, it may be worth questioning whether this system truly accommodates the diverse needs of individuals or if we should explore new possibilities concepts that might seem as improbable as an Earth that is no longer a sphere.</p>

    <h1>Strengthening The Coummunity</h1>
    <div class="im1"> <img src="img4/img23.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img24.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img25.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img26.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img27.png" alt=""> <img src="img4/img28.png" alt="">
        <p>In indigenous cultures, circles symbolize the interconnectedness and interdependence of all life forms. They are sacred spaces where people gather, share stories, and celebrate communal ties. The circular arrangement fosters a sense of equality, where everyone is seen and heard, reinforcing the idea that every voice is important in the community.</p>
        <p> In contrast, traditional school settings often arrange students in rows, all facing forward toward a single focal point: the teacher. This setup can create a hierarchical dynamic, where students passively receive information rather than actively engage with each other. If schools were designed more like circles, where students and teachers come together to exchange ideas and collaborate, education might feel more like a communal experience. This approach could nurture a stronger sense of connection and understanding among students, encouraging them to see learning as a shared journey rather than a solitary task.</p>
        <p>Circles hold profound significance in indigenous cultures and are deeply valued for their symbolism and function. From the circular shapes of drums, which produce rhythmic sounds resonating with the heartbeat of the Earth, to communal gatherings in drum circles, these shapes serve as a powerful reminder of connection and unity. Sun dances, performed in circular formations, are another example of how indigenous traditions use circles to bring people together in celebration and prayer. In indigenous cultures, circles are not merely geometric shapes; they embody the unbroken cycles of life, nature, and the universe. They symbolize the continuity and interdependence of all living things, reflecting the belief that life is a series of interconnected and recurring events.</p>

        <p>There is a fascinating phenomenon where sick animals, from large horses to tiny ants, tend to walk in circles. Take sheep, for example: when unwell, they often walk in a continuous circle, following the sheep ahead of them in a single-file line. This behavior is both intriguing and unsettling, as these sick sheep mindlessly follow one another without apparent reason or purpose. It strikes me as a reflection of human behavior. Perhaps humans, in our own way, are also "sick." Many of us, particularly university students, live our lives in a kind of metaphorical circle. Each day, we wake up at home, commute to campus, attend classes, return home, sleep, and repeat the cycle. I find myself walking in this big circle day after day, year after year. The education system has made me feel like one of those mindless sheep, following the path laid out by those ahead of me, pursuing grades and achievements for reasons I don't fully understand.</p>
            
            <p> This brings to mind another intriguing concept: the nature of life itself. Life often begins as a small, circular form a seed planted in the ground that grows into a magnificent tree, an egg that hatches into a duckling, or a human egg fertilized into life. These small circles mark the beginnings of existence, from which all living things emerge and grow into their unique forms. In contemplating these circles both literal and metaphorical we see how life and routine often mirror one another. From the cyclical patterns of behavior in animals to the daily routines of humans, the circle serves as a powerful symbol of continuity and transformation. It prompts us to question whether we are mindlessly following a predetermined path or if we have the agency to break free and create our own paths. Perhaps recognizing these circles in our lives is the first step toward understanding and ultimately redefining them.</p>
